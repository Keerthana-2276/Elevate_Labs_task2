# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset**. The analysis is implemented using **Google Colab** and leverages Python libraries like `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, and `Plotly`.

---

## 📌 Objective

To understand the Titanic dataset through:
- Summary statistics
- Data cleaning
- Visualization techniques
- Correlation and pattern discovery
- Basic feature-level inferences

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains details of passengers aboard the Titanic, including:
- PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age
- Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- Pclass, SibSp, Parch
- Survived (Target variable)

> You will be prompted to upload the `.csv` file manually when running the Colab notebook.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
- Google Colab for interactive execution

---

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- Display of dataset structure, shape, data types, and missing values.
- Summary statistics using `.describe()` for quick overview.
- Histograms and Boxplots for visualizing distributions and outliers.
- Heatmap showing correlations between numeric variables.
- Pairplots for detecting potential feature interactions.
- Interactive scatter matrix using Plotly for better pattern recognition.
- Categorical analysis for survival insights based on `Sex` and `Embarked`.

## 📷 Sample Visuals

> These plots will be generated during the analysis:
- 📊 Histograms for numeric features
- 📦 Boxplots to identify outliers
- 🔗 Correlation heatmap
- 🤝 Pairplot for feature interactions
- 🎯 Interactive scatter matrix
- 🧍 Countplots (Survival vs Sex / Embarked)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run the notebook cells.
3. When prompted, **upload your Titanic `.csv` file**.
4. The notebook will automatically generate insights and visualizations.
